## Content
In a **Star Topology**, all devices connect individually to a central point (usually a [hub](hub.md), [switch](switch.md), or [router](router.md)). Traffic flows from the source device to the central one, then to the destination.

**Pros**: Easy to manage, a failure between the device and the central device only affects that device, not the other ones.
Cons: If the central node fails, the entire network goes  down.
Use case: Home networks ([LAN](LAN.md)/Wi-Fi routers)

## Connections:
- Contrasts with [topology-mesh](topology-mesh.md)
- Real world example: [home_network_setup](home_network_setup.md) (router as center)

Differs from the centralization seen in [topology-mesh.md](topology-mesh.md.md)
It is the most common topology in modern Local Area Networks (LANs), facilitating the application of [infranet-vs-extranet.md](infranet-vs-extranet.md.md)
