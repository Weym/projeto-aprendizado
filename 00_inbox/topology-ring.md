Devices are connected in a closed loop. Data travels in a single direction, passing from node to node until it reaches the destination, often using a token to control who speaks.

Advantage: Avoids data collision, traffic is predictable.
Disadvantage: Failure on one device can bring down the entire ring.

Connections:
Compared to [[topology-point-to-point]], it's a series of direct connections forming a cycle.
